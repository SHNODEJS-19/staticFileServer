# staticFileServer
capstone project inspired by side hustle internship

About:
This is a static file server which simply renders static html files when the following end points are requested;
/ : which returns the home page as html;
/about: which returns the about page as html;
/sys: this returns a simple plain text.


This app was created using express to make routing easier.

Thank you.
